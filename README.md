Create a function that takes a number as a parameter and returns fizz if the number is divisible by 3 
and buzz if the number is divisible by 5. If it is divisible by 3 and 5 it should return fizzbuzz. 
Your function should output as follows 
Input 	           Output 
fizzBuzz(45)      // "fizz"
fizzBuzz(20)      // "buzz"
fizzBuzz(15)      //"fizzbuzz"
Extra Credit 
your function should return "flat soda" if the input is not a number. Your function should return "please enter a number" 
if the input is not a number.
Input               Output
fizzBuzz(7)         //"flat soda"
fizzBuzz("hello")   // "please enter a number"
